## Body

### What you'll need
- [car body design printed on card stock](../../design_body/car_body_CUT.pdf)
- scissors
- X-acto knife
- cutting mat (to protect your desk when cutting stuff)
- straight-edge or ruler
- glue (or scotch tape)

**How to cut and score the different types of lines on the car body design:**

- **solid line**: Cut all the way through using scissors.
- **rectangle/trapezoid with an X through it**: Cut all the way through using X-acto knife.
- To help fold:
    - **dotted line**: Score on the top of the sheet.
    - **dashed line**: Score on the bottom of the sheet.

Always use a straight-edge when scoring or making cuts.

When scoring, err on the side of caution by scoring very lightly or else you may accidentally cut all the way through.

Use scissors to cut solid lines on the outer edges.

Glue together the front and roof/rear panels. Make sure you've cut out the holes for the windsheild, hood scoop, and four support prongs.

Apply a little bit of glue along the tab, like so. (Remember: Less is more! Too much glue will warp the paper.)

Apply gentle pressure until the glue holds.

Apply glue on all the tabs on one side of the car body. Then quickly attach a side panel...

...like so.

Should look like this.

Then do the other side.

Have your cat double-check your work.
