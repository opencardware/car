# Camera

### What you'll need:

- [camera parts](../../design_3d_print/README.md)
- Raspberry Pi camera
- camera ribbon cable (8" long)

To successfully connect the Pi to your camera when it's mounted at the front of the car, you will need a slightly longer ribbon cable than the one that usually comes with these cameras. The ribbon should be at least 8" long.

Get the `camera_scoop` and `camera_roof`...

...and snap them together, like so.

Attach that piece to `camera_cactus_L` and `camera_cactus_R`.

Put the scoop down and insert the two `camera_hold` pieces into the remaining holes on the `camera_roof` and the tracks on the `camera_cactus` pieces. Use two fingers (as shown) to keep the `camera_hold` pieces from falling out.

With your other hand, slide in the camera into the `camera_hold` pieces. The ribbon should be coming out the top of the camera and tucked behind it (and it's okay to fold the ribbon back, as shown).

Once your camera is slid in all the way, it should look like this when the scoop is lifted up.

Finally, connect your camera ribbon to the Pi. It will go under the LCD screen mount.
